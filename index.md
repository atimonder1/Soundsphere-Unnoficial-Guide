# Welcome
Well, welcome to the unofficial soundsphere guide, i guess? This thing was designed to help install and configure soundsphere on their PC. It's not that hard as you think if you visited this page.
# Downloading
## Downloading (Linux)
Firstly, you need to install **git**. This thing is for "cloning" the main game. To install it you need to:
  For Debian-based distributions: ```sudo apt-get install git```;
  For Fedora-based distributions: ```sudo dnf install git```;
  For Arch-based distributions: ```sudo pacman -S git```;
  For Gentoo-based distributions: ```emerge --ask dev-vcs/git```.
After you have done this, you simply write to the console ```git clone https://github.com/semyon422/soundsphere-updater```. Next, you go into this directory and write ```chmod +x launcher.sh```, in order to be able to launch the launcher. Then, just do ```./launcher.sh``` to launch the launcher. Then, you click **2** to download the game. After this, you need to enter directory "soundsphere-master" and do "chmod +x start-linux64", otherwise your game won't start. Also, for the game to work properly, you need to install the following packages:
  For Arch-based distributions: ```sudo pacman -S git luajit curl love ffmpeg sqlite openssl```; (todo)
If you want actually to start the game you need to click **1** on your keyboard.
